"10. A point, line, or surface from which elevations are measured is a:","a. monument.\nb. benchmark.\nc. datum.\nd. section.","c. datum.","A datum is the reference point for heights and depths (air/subsurface rights)."
"11. To determine the number of acres in a rectangular survey description, you divide 640 by:","a. the number of sections.\nb. the denominator of each fraction.\nc. the principal meridian.\nd. the range number.","b. the denominator of each fraction.","Example: 1/4 of 1/4 = 640 / 4 / 4 = 40 acres."
"12. The survey that provides the location, size, and shape of buildings on a lot is a:","a. plat map.\nb. spot survey.\nc. geodetic survey.\nd. range survey.","b. spot survey.","Spot surveys show where improvements (buildings) sit on the land."

"14. A township line runs:","a. North and South.\nb. East and West.\nc. Diagonally.\nb. Parallel to the meridian.","b. East and West.","Township lines run east-west; Range lines run north-south."
"15. Section 16 in a township is traditionally reserved for:","a. the post office.\nb. the church.\nc. public schools.\nd. the town hall.","c. public schools.","Section 16 is the 'school section'."
"16. Which of the following is NOT a valid legal description?","a. Metes and bounds\nb. Lot and block\nc. Street address\nd. Rectangular survey","c. Street address.","Street addresses are 'informal' and not legally binding for deeds."
"17. The starting point in a metes-and-bounds description is the:","a. principal meridian.\nb. POB.\nc. datum.\nd. benchmark.","b. POB.","POB = Point of Beginning."
"18. A township square is:","a. 1 mile square.\nb. 6 miles square.\nc. 36 miles square.\nd. 640 acres.","b. 6 miles square.","A '6-mile square' is 36 square miles."
"19. Permanent reference markers, such as an iron pin or brass plate, are:","a. benchmarks.\nb. monuments.\nc. sections.\nd. base lines.","a. benchmarks.","Benchmarks are permanent reference points for surveyors."
"20. Air lots are measured using:","a. acres.\nb. square feet.\nc. datums.\nd. sections.","c. datums.","Height is measured from a specific datum."
